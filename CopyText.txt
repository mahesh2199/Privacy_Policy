Subject: Request to Enroll in Appian Training

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to express my interest in enrolling in the Appian training program offered by your organization. I am eager to enhance my skills in Appian and believe that this training will be invaluable in helping me achieve my professional goals.

Could you please provide me with the details of the training schedule, enrollment process, and any prerequisites? I would appreciate it if you could also share information about the training fees and course materials.

Thank you for your assistance, and I look forward to your response.

Best regards,


I have received a job offer with a CTC of 13 LPA from another company. Currently, my CTC is 8.9 LPA, and I have been with WNS since July 29, 2013. Over the years, I have dedicated myself to my role and last received a promotion in January 2016. Since then, I have upskilled myself by learning RPA tools and successfully completing multiple projects.

However, despite my efforts and contributions, I have not received the desired salary increment in the past 6â€“7 years. I am currently awaiting my promotion and salary revision. If I receive at least a 20% salary increment (bringing my CTC to 11 LPA), I would be happy to continue with WNS, as I have been a part of this organization for over 10 years and genuinely enjoy working here.

Thank you.

Hi Infosec Team,

The following request has been pending your approval since July 20, 2025. I have already received approval from the other manager. Kindly expedite the approval process, as this is required for the Automation Anywhere AI Agent training program.

Thank you for your assistance.
