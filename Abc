Hi Niraj,

I tried all the options mentioned in the article below, but I'm still encountering the same error. According to the article, we are only uploading PDF files (which are not password protected), not PNG files. Additionally, in the production control room, we don't have access to upload documents manually; we can only upload documents using the bot. However, we're still facing the same error.
